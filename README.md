# COFFEE TALK

This project was my entrance to web design. It is written in HTML and CSS, and implements some of the Bootstrap 5.0 framework.

At Germantown Friends School, high school students must complete a project during January of their junior year, and I took these three weeks to explore web development and continue my work in journalism. This website is the summation of my junior project, which I completed in January, 2022.

Through the Coursera course, [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers), taught by Yaakov Chaikin,
I spent two weeks learning HTML and CSS, and one week building the website. During these three weeks, I also interviewed local coffee shop owners and wrote profile pieces about them, which are featured on the site. 

I paid particular attention to creating a responsive design that is visually appealing on different sized devices. I hope you enjoy my work!
